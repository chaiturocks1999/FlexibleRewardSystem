# FlexibleRewardSystem
This project consists of a system that will accurately monitor the open or closed state of the driverâ€™s eyes in real-time using OpenCV. The system will monitor the driver's eye movements &amp; blink patterns using a camera. A warning alarm will be issued if a prolonged blink is observed.
